1. Jacobi(Input_matrix_A, Input_vector_b, Initial_X, epsilon, max_iter)

Jacobi() function is the way to solve linear equations AX = b

The method that will be used is Iterative methos for solving system linear equations.

2. GaussHermite(mu, sigma2, N)

In numerical analysis, Gauss-Hermite quadrature is a form of Gaussian quadrature for approximating the value of integrals of the following kind:

integral(e^(-x^2) f(x) dx) from (-inf, inf)
